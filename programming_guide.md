# Programming Guide for New CTA Developers

## 1. Key Programming Paradigms

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Definition**: A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain data and code
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit
  - Inheritance: Creating new classes that are built upon existing classes
  - Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types or classes)
  - Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only necessary features

Example:

```python
class Ticket:
    def __init__(self, origin, destination, price):
        self.origin = origin
        self.destination = destination
        self.price = price
    
    def calculate_tax(self):
        return self.price * 0.1
```

### Functional Programming
- **Definition**: A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Immutability: Data cannot be changed once created
  - Pure Functions: Functions that always produce the same output for the same input
  - First-class Functions: Functions can be assigned to variables and passed as arguments
  - Higher-order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments

Example:

```python
# Functional approach to calculating ticket prices
def apply_discount(price, discount_rate):
    return price * (1 - discount_rate)

prices = [100, 200, 300]
discounted_prices = map(lambda x: apply_discount(x, 0.1), prices)
```

## 2. Language Constructs

### Variables and Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: int, float, string, boolean
- **Complex Types**: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- **Custom Types**: classes, enums

### Control Structures
```python
# Conditional Statements
if condition:
    # code block
elif another_condition:
    # code block
else:
    # code block

# Loops
for item in collection:
    # code block

while condition:
    # code block
```

### Functions and Methods
```python
# Basic function
def calculate_fare(distance, rate):
    return distance * rate

# Method in a class
class FareCalculator:
    def calculate_fare(self, distance, rate):
        return distance * rate
```

## 3. Programming vs Scripting

### Programming Languages (e.g., Java, C++)
- Compiled languages that need to be converted to machine code before execution
- Stronger type checking and enforcement
- More structured and verbose
- Better for large-scale applications

Example:
```java
public class TicketSystem {
    private double basePrice;
    
    public TicketSystem(double basePrice) {
        this.basePrice = basePrice;
    }
    
    public double calculateFare(double distance) {
        return this.basePrice * distance;
    }
}
```

### Scripting Languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript)
- Interpreted languages that execute directly
- More flexible and dynamic typing
- Faster development time
- Better for automation and small tasks

Example:
```python
# Simple ticket pricing script
base_price = 2.50
distance = 5

fare = base_price * distance
print(f"Your fare is: ${fare}")
```

### Key Differences
1. **Compilation**:
   - Programming Languages: Require compilation
   - Scripting Languages: Interpreted at runtime

2. **Type System**:
   - Programming Languages: Usually statically typed
   - Scripting Languages: Usually dynamically typed

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Programming Languages: Large applications, system software
   - Scripting Languages: Automation, web development, rapid prototyping

4. **Development Speed**:
   - Programming Languages: More time to develop but better performance
   - Scripting Languages: Faster development but potentially slower execution

## Best Practices for CTA Development
1. Write clean, well-documented code
2. Follow consistent naming conventions
3. Use version control (Git) effectively
4. Write unit tests for critical functionality
5. Review code before committing
6. Keep security in mind when handling user data

## 4. Version Control with Git

### Common Git Commands and Their Purpose
- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository
- `git clone <url>`: Create a copy of a remote repository
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit
- `git commit -m "message"`: Save staged changes with a descriptive message
- `git push`: Upload local commits to remote repository
- `git pull`: Download and integrate changes from remote repository
- `git branch <name>`: Create a new branch
- `git checkout <branch>`: Switch to a different branch
- `git merge <branch>`: Combine changes from different branches
- `git status`: Show current state of working directory
- `git log`: View commit history

### Value of Version Control in Development
1. **Collaboration Benefits**:
   - Multiple developers can work simultaneously
   - Changes can be tracked and merged systematically
   - Conflicts can be resolved methodically

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Code review process is facilitated
   - Changes can be reverted if issues arise
   - Experimental features can be developed in branches

3. **Project Management**:
   - Progress can be tracked effectively
   - Releases can be tagged and managed
   - Documentation history is maintained

## 5. Solution Handover Guidelines

### Software Documentation
1. **Code Documentation**:
   - Inline comments explaining complex logic
   - Function and class documentation
   - API documentation for interfaces
   - README files for setup instructions

2. **System Documentation**:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Database schemas
   - Deployment configurations
   - Environment setup guides

### Integration Guidelines
1. **Adding New Zones**:
   ```python
   # Example of adding a new zone
   class TransitZone:
       def __init__(self, zone_id, name, stations):
           self.zone_id = zone_id
           self.name = name
           self.stations = stations
   
   # Add to existing zones
   zones.append(new_zone)
   ```

2. **Adding New Stations**:
   ```python
   # Example of adding a new station
   class Station:
       def __init__(self, station_id, name, zone, connections):
           self.station_id = station_id
           self.name = name
           self.zone = zone
           self.connections = connections
   
   # Add to existing stations
   stations[new_station.station_id] = new_station
   ```

### Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Installation Steps**:
   - Clone repository
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Install dependencies
   - Configure database
   - Run migrations
   - Start application

2. **Maintenance Procedures**:
